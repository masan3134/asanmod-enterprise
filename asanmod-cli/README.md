# 🛡️ ASANMOD CLI: The Agent's Physical Barrier

> **FOR AI AGENTS ONLY: READ THIS BEFORE CODING.**

## 🤖 Introduction

You are an AI Agent entering an **ASANMOD Governed Space**.
This CLI (`@asanmod/cli`) is your physical interface to correct reality. It enforces the **0/0/0 Protocol** (Zero Lint, Zero Types, Zero Logs).

## ⚡ Your Command Interface

You must use the `asan` command to validate your existence and work.

### 1. Verification (MANDATORY)

Before submitting ANY task, you MUST run:

```bash
asan verify
```

- **Exit Code 0:** You are compliant. Proceed.
- **Exit Code 1:** You have failed. **DO NOT PROCEED.** Fix the errors.

### 2. Status Check

To understand the current state of longevity and context:

```bash
asan status
```

### 3. Self-Correction

If you are stuck or confused:

```bash
asan fix
```

## 🔒 The Physical Laws

1.  **No Hallucinations:** Configuration is strictly defined in `asanmod.config.json`. Do not invent paths.
2.  **No Secrets:** Never write secrets to files. Use `.env` only.
3.  **Strict Mode:** If `asan verify` fails, you are PHYSICALLY blocked from proceeding.
